## About
Howdy, my names **Hawkmask**. 
- I am a current senior Computer Engineering and Engineering (MECH) student who also dabbles in modern physics and advanced math. 
- I’m interested in making cyborgs and space robots and training up more to do likewise. 

**In less sci-fi terms (*and more boring terms*):**
    
    - I research tech to expand the capabilities of the human body.
    - I design low cost solutions to help those with disabilities.
    - I develop tools that will one day allow us to know our solarsystem better.
    - I hope to one day pass my passion for helping others and learning on to the next generation.
    
- I'm really excited about machine learning and the prospects of low cost ways to manufacture advanced sensors.
- I hope to pursue a PhD in robotics and am currently applying for masters degrees at CMU and OSU. 

## Collaboration

*I’m looking to collaborate on any robotics project. Pretty much anything goes, but I'm especially interested in bipedal legged locomotion, human augmentation, novel sensing methods, space, and anything else cool!*

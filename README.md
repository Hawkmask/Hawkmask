# About: Academic
Howdy, my names **Hawkmask** (not actually, but I'm shy). 
- I am a current robotics grad student.
- I’m interested in making cyborgs and space robots and training up more to do likewise. 
- I hold my B.S. in Mechanical Engineering and Computer Engineering


**In less sci-fi terms (*and more boring terms*):**
    
    - I research tech to expand the capabilities of the human body.
    - I design low cost solutions to help those with disabilities.
    - I develop tools that will one day allow us to know our solarsystem better.
    - I hope to one day pass my passion for helping others and learning on to the next generation.
    
- I'm really excited about machine learning and the prospects of low cost ways to manufacture advanced sensors.

## Collaboration

*I’m looking to collaborate on any robotics project. Pretty much anything goes, but I'm especially interested in bipedal legged locomotion, human augmentation, novel sensing methods, space, and anything else cool!*
